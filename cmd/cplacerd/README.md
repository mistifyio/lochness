[![cplacerd](https://godoc.org/github.com/mistifyio/lochness/cmd/cplacerd?status.png)](https://godoc.org/github.com/mistifyio/lochness/cmd/cplacerd)

cplacerd is the guest placement daemon. It monitors a beanstalk queue for
requests to create new guests. It then decides which hypervisor a new guest
should be created under based on a variety of criteria. It does not actually
communicate with the hypervisor, but creates the job for `cworkerd` to process.


### Usage

The following arguments are understood:

    $ cplacerd -h
    Usage of cplacerd:
    -b, --beanstalk="127.0.0.1:11300": address of beanstalkd server
    -k, --kv="http://127.0.0.1:4001": address of kv server
    -p, --http=7543: address for http interface. set to 0 to disable
    -l, --log-level="warn": log level

Only one instance should be run per cluster, typically ensured by running it via
`lock`.
